# OpenAIConnector-Spectacles
A Lens Studio Project that allows you capture images and send to openAI.


*NOTE*
You will require an API Key from OpenAI, you can find that here: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys

There is also the standalone OpenAI Connector script file you can download if you do not want the entire lens studio project here: https://github.com/Oluwatosin-Ogunyebi/OpenAIConnector-Spectacles/blob/main/OpenAIConnector_Standalone.lsc
